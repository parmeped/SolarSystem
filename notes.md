Assumptions:
A circle has 360 degrees, the objects are in a circular orbit arround the sun therefore Length of track is 360. 
Year length is 365. 
Object on position x is on same degree as another object on position x.
Everything is BASED on a cycle approach.
every event happens n time on a cycle, therefore multiplying n * amountCycles = finalAmount


drought season:
//DONE have to correct the implementation so that it checks for every position with each other, as to find the one with least intersections.
//DONE have to calculate for N cycles. aka years

Rain season:

Most Rain:

Optimum climate:
this is when the three points are collinear. AND! they are NOT collinear with the sun. (test for the remaining point? ORRR use the days there's drough! on those days, we should NOT check for collinearity. Maybe implement both approaches, since one's more efficient and the other one is a compromise.)
First have to convert the polar coordinates into cartesian coordinates. 


problems: 
could take less than a day to complete a cycle.
