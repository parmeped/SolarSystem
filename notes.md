Everything is BASED on a cycle approach.

drought season:
//DONE have to correct the implementation so that it checks for every position with each other, as to find the one with least intersections.
//DONE have to calculate for N cycles. aka years

Rain season:

Most Rain:

Optimum climate:
this is when the three points are collinear. AND! they are NOT collinear with the sun. (test for the remaining point? ORRR use the days there's drough! on those days, we should NOT check for collinearity. Maybe implement both approaches, since one's more efficient and the other one is a compromise.)
First have to convert the polar coordinates into cartesian coordinates. 


problems: 
could take less than a day to complete a cycle.
